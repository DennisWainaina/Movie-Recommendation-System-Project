    "Creating recommendation systems is a famous problem in our society, such is the importance of such a problem that Netflix, a streaming service, once offered $1 Million as a prize to anyone who could beat their own recommendation systems by 10%. This prize was won in 2009 by a team of researchers called `Belker's Pragmatic Chaos` in 2009 after 3 years of competition. Netflix has also said that they would lose over a billion dollars each year in revenue if it wasn't for their recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this, a startup company in Kenya called Phoenix Incorporated has decided to start its own streaming service to compete with the likes of Showmax, Netflix and Prime Video which are all available in Kenya. The idea of Phoenix as a startup company is to offer the same variety as a company like Netflix but at a lower price so as to accessible by the average Kenyan in this economy. Phoenix Incorporated understands that in order for a streaming service to be successful it has to have a good recommendation system so as to keep its clients happy and to attract new clients hence more revenue. In order to this, they have decided to hire a famous Data science firm called Regex Analytics to assist them in this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "After meeting with one of the representatives from Phoenix Incorporated the CEO of Regex Analytics has decided to give this task to the head Data Scientist in the firm. The head has then decided to delegate this task to one of the experienced data scientists in his team. This experienced data scientist is to build a recommendation system that recommends 5 movies that users may like based on previous choices and what others liked from the streaming platform so as to address the cold start problem. The experienced data scientist is then supposed to present this model to the head data scientist who will then show it to the CEO. He is also to create a presentation on the project mentioned above as a summary of his findings to a non-technical audience which will also include some members from Phoenix Incorporated."

    "The goal is to build a recommendation system that recommends 5 movies to a user based on previous things watched and what other users with similar interests have watched. The measure of success will therefore be a working recommendation system that is able to offer recommendations to new and old users with at least 70% accuracy. This is lower than major platforms like Netflix's accuracy of 80% but is still a good starting point. The model can them be improved later based on suggestion from users as Netflix even as a company has been around for more than 10 years, hence it has had time to improve its recommendation systems to almost perfect."
